Professional Experience
Machine Learning Engineer
Stevens Institute of Technology (Projects) | Sep 2023 - May 2025
Engineered and deployed ML pipelines for recommender systems and predictive analytics using Spark and GCP.
Achieved 97.6% forecasting accuracy in a SARIMA-based time-series model applied to institutional datasets.
Built GPT-powered tooling that dynamically aligns resumes to job descriptions, improving targeting efficiency. 
Web Developer
Freelance | Feb 2022 - May 2022
Developed 3+ portfolio websites for photographers, increasing client visibility significantly.
Improved user engagement and traffic by 20% through responsive design and SEO optimisation.
Event Operations
Debaun Student Staff, Stevens Institute of Technology | Sep 2024 - May 2025
Directed high - impact event setups (12+) under time-critical conditions with zero execution failures.
Developed real-time response play-books, reducing issue resolution time by over 60%. 
Projects
Scalable Movie Recommendation System | Apache Spark, GCP, PySpark, MLlib, Dataproc
Designed and built a scalable recommendation system using ALS on MovieLens 25M, deployed locally and to multi-node GCP Dataproc clusters. Incorporated Clustering and relevance scoring and diversity optimisation.
Tuned ALS hyperparameters and Spark executor configs to process full dataset with RMSE under 0.8.
Developed fallback strategies for cold-start handling and a built-in diversity scoring using cosine metrics. 
Fraud Detection System | Python, PyTorch, XGBoost, GNN
Built a hybrid fraud detection model with GNNs for transaction graphs and XGBoost for tabular classification.
Boosted fraud precision to 93%, cutting false positives by 25% through ensemble fusion.
JobMate - Resume Tailoring & Cover Letter Generator | Python, Streamlit, OpenAI API
Developed an interactive resume and cover letter generator using NLP techniques and GPT for semantic matching and keyword fit.
Used Streamlit to deploy a sleek, user - friendly app that reduces job application overhead.
Real Estate Investment Optimiser | Python, Statistical Analysis
Identified 12-18% undervalued NYC properties (p<0.001) through analysis of 4,801 listings and 17-variable modelling.
Engineered a spatial binning approach over latitude and longitude features to aggregate property-level data into geographic grids, producing interpretable bin maps that visually resembled NYCâ€™s structure and enabled trend analysis.
Portfolio Website | TypeScript, React, Vite, CSS
Built a fully responsive portfolio to showcase projects, resume, and contact info using React TypeScript.
Deployed on Github Pages with custom component library and mobile-first design.
